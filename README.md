# Classification of Medical Specialties through Clinical Text Analysis using Natural Language Processing
This project aims to develop a model that can accurately classify medical specialties based on clinical text transcriptions. By leveraging natural language processing techniques, the model will be trained to identify and extract relevant features from the medical transcriptions, enabling it to distinguish between various specialties. The developed model will be beneficial for healthcare professionals, medical institutions, and researchers in organizing and managing clinical data, as well as for the development of medical expert systems.

## Overview
This project focuses on developing an NLP model to classify medical specialties based on clinical text transcriptions. The developed model could assist healthcare professionals, institutions, and researchers in managing clinical data and developing medical expert systems.

## Data
The primary data source for this project is the [Medical Transcriptions](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tboyle10/medicaltranscriptions) dataset from Kaggle.
